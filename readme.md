# Virtualist

Simple, performant and cross-browser virtual list inspired from [CSS contentVisibility](https://web.dev/content-visibility/).

- Perfect for rows with dynamic heights
- Supports infinite loading out-of-the-box
- Coded as a custom React hook

### TODO

- benchmarks
- extend examples
- add tests
- readme documentation
- npm package

### Development

To start the example app you must first build and link the package:

- `yarn build` - generate the files in `dist`
- `yarn link` - create symlink to `@dims/virtualist`
- `yarn start` - link to the symlinked package and start the example app
